# PI Header embedded

This module fetched `pi-header` and create a local server that shows it with custom configuration.
This module could be used to embed `pi-header` in an isolated fron-end project so that it will be easier for devs and QA to simulate logged in user.

```
npm install
```

Start local server (builds and server files from `build` folder)
```
npm start
```
